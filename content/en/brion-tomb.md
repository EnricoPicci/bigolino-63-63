# The Brion Tomb

## A masterpiece half an hour from the Prosecco

If you're in the area for the party and have a spare morning (or need to walk off a hangover with some contemplative strolling), **half an hour from Valdobbiadene** lies one of Italy's most extraordinary places. This is not drunken hyperbole: the Brion Tomb is considered the supreme work of twentieth-century Italian architecture. Like, actually.

## The Brions and Brionvega

The **Brion** family founded **Brionvega**, the company that turned radios and televisions into objects people bought to *display in their living rooms even when switched off*. If you've ever seen those 1960s TV sets that look like they escaped from a Kubrick film, you know what we're talking about.

**Giuseppe Brion**, the founder, was a visionary from the Veneto -- the kind of person who looked at post-war rubble in 1945 and thought "you know what goes here? A factory making designer televisions". And he was right. Brionvega became the symbol of Italy's economic miracle, the company that proved Italians could do electronics *and* make them beautiful.

Then, as in every good Italian story, things got complicated. After Giuseppe's death in 1968, the company changed hands more often than a football in Fantasy League. Acquisitions, crises, relaunch attempts, failures. Brionvega today is a brand that reissues its past classics -- a bit like the Rolling Stones doing reunion tours, but with radios. The design is immortal; the business plan, less so.

## Carlo Scarpa: the illegal genius

This is where the story gets absurd. **Carlo Scarpa** (Venice, 1906 - Sendai, 1978) is universally regarded as one of the greatest architects of the twentieth century. There's just one small detail: **he wasn't an architect**. Not in the legal sense, at least. It's as if Maradona had played in Serie A without a player's license.

Scarpa graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice, not from a faculty of architecture. In **1956**, the Architects' Association of Venice reported him for **"abusivismo professionale"** -- the illegal practice of architecture. The man who was redesigning the Venice Biennale, who had reinvented the Castelvecchio Museum in Verona, who was admired worldwide... was technically an outlaw. Like those people who build illegal conservatories in Palermo, but with more class.

> *A genius deemed illegal by bureaucracy. In Italy, some things never change. Fortunately, neither does genius.*

Scarpa would spend his entire career signing projects as "professor" and collaborating with registered architects. The system didn't want him? He kept designing masterpieces out of spite.

## Onorina: the real boss

Giuseppe Brion commissioned the tomb from Scarpa, but died before seeing it completed (1968). It was **Onorina Tomasin-Brion** who carried the project forward for ten years, simultaneously managing the company and the ever-more-ambitious demands of an architect-not-architect who wanted to turn a country cemetery into the Taj Mahal of the Veneto. Iron lady? Reinforced concrete lady.

## Japan in the heart of the Veneto

Visitors to the Brion Tomb are struck by something unexpected: **it feels like Japan**. Not Bassano, not Castelfranco -- actual Japan. This is no accident. Scarpa had an almost romantic obsession with Japanese aesthetics:

- The **meditation pavilion**, floating on water like a Zen temple (but surrounded by radicchio fields)
- The **gardens** with their dry-garden (*karesansui*) sensibility
- The **chapel**, intimate and enclosed like a tea room
- The use of **exposed concrete** treated with an almost textile delicacy -- as if the brutal and the delicate had met over an aperitivo
- The **interlocking circles** of the arcosolium, symbol of the eternal union between the Brion spouses

And here comes fate's cruellest irony. In **1978**, Scarpa finally realised his dream of travelling to Japan. In **Sendai**, he fell down the concrete stairs of his hotel and died of his injuries. The master of concrete and stairs, undone by both. If it were a film, audiences would say "too much".

> *By his own wish, he is buried right here, in the Brion Tomb, standing upright, wrapped in a suit he designed himself -- like a Venetian samurai. Even in death, he couldn't dress like everyone else.*

## What to see

- **The arcosolium**: the arch sheltering the Brion sarcophagi, with two circles interlocking -- pure geometry becoming poetry. Try making people cry with concrete
- **The chapel**: a gathered space where light enters like a thought. Silence mandatory, even for those who had too much Prosecco the night before
- **The meditation pool**: the pavilion on water, where the sky reflects and time stands still. Bring mosquito repellent in summer
- **The lawn**: the garden connecting everything, where every step reveals a new detail. Scarpa hid architectural surprises like a grandfather hides sweets
- **Scarpa's tomb**: in the north-east corner, discreet, like its author. Standing upright, as we mentioned. Because even in death, Carlo Scarpa didn't do things like everyone else

## Practical information

**Where**: Cemetery of San Vito d'Altivole (TV), Via Cavour
**Distance from Valdobbiadene**: about 30 minutes by car (sober)
**Admission**: free (donation welcome)
**Hours**: every day, cemetery hours (generally 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM)

**Tips**: go early in the morning, when the light is low and no one is around. Wear comfortable shoes and bring respect. And maybe a bottle of Prosecco for afterwards -- Scarpa would have approved.
