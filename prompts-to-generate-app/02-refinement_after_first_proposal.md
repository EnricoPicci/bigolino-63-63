# Refinements after the first proposal
The first proposal seems overall good.
There are some refinements to make.

## The guys short descriptions
For each of the 4 guys do a search on the web to get some data to make the 4 short descriptions funny but also with some real elements.\
The full names of the guys are: Giovanni Della Frattina, Enrico Piccinin, Stefano Visentin, Luigi Zingales.

## The interactive element
I like the second idea, "Lo spettro politico", not the first one.

## Options for accommodations
Search on the web which are the options for accommodations for those who wnat to stay in the surroundings for the night.\
List this options somewhere in the website.

## Date and time
The party will be held on June 27th, starting from 19:00.

## Ironic note in the footer
The note should be something like "Anche l'AI beve prosecco".

## Technical questions
### No framework
Good choice, no framework needed.
### Tailwind CSS
I read that Tailwind is an unnecessary complication. If it is, do not use it. Otherwise, explain which advantages it gives us over vanilla CSS.
### Hosting
GitHub pages seems the natural place, since we are already hosting the code in GitHub. Which are the advantages of using other hosting options?
### Potential needs for a dynamic behaviour
Assume we want, at a later stage, add some dynamic behavior, e.g. a confirmation page where a guest can confirm the attendance, how complex it would be to change the website?\
Even if this is not an immediate requirement, try to find solutions that make this potential development not too comples
### Tests
Is it possible to add some tests and a command to run such tests?
### One single HTML page
One single html page is fine
### Images
It must be easy to add images and see some effects on the website, as easy as just dropping them in teh "pictures" folder.


# New requirements
## Easy to change
One important element is to make sure that the site content is easy to modify without the need to use Claude.\
The source code of the website will be available to all the 4 guys, and they are not very used to use development tools.\
Therefore make sure that:
- it is easy to find the text of the various sections
- it is easy to change them (guaranteeing though that only committed changes are published)
- there is a short but clear documentation on how to change the content of parts of the site

# Your task
Your task is to review the proposal you have made and document the new proposal in a markdown document, different from the first one you created.
