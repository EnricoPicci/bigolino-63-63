Is it possible to add some music to the site?
I would like to have "I wish" from Steve Wonder as background music.

I'd love to help, but there are a couple of important things to consider first:                                                     
                                                                                                                                      
  Copyright issue: "I Wish" by Stevie Wonder is copyrighted. Hosting the audio file on your site or playing it without a license would
   be a copyright infringement, even for a personal party site.
                                                                                                                                      
  Browser restrictions: Modern browsers block auto-playing audio. Users would need to click to start playback anyway.               

  Here are some alternatives that would work:

  1. Embed a YouTube/Spotify player - Link to the official song via an embedded player. This is legal since the platforms handle
  licensing. It also lets guests choose to play it.
  2. Add a "party playlist" link - A Spotify/YouTube playlist link that guests can open separately (could include "I Wish" and other
  1963-era songs).
  3. Use royalty-free music - If you really want background audio, use a royalty-free track with a similar vibe.
